## EMotIOnal Drainage: A Prelude 



"Emotional drainage” is a term which we may have often felt but generally we never  bring to our plate of discussion as the interpretation cannot be explained as precisely as another type of exhaustion . In our daily lives we often feel exhausted after tirelessly working for a longer duration or trying to accomplish some task . But what about each day when we emotionally get exhausted and cannot even speak out or understand its impact . Each one of us have some level of hope or expectation from onself; its innate and naturally being adopted by each one of us . As a recourse of exhausation what we generally opt is like “ a cup of coffee”, “ pamper our body”, “ eat good food “, “ go for vacation”, “ hangout with friends”, “ play music”, adopt ourselves to numerous activities for focusing ourselves to the curiculum of life cycle. 



Do we even realise or introspect about our mental exhausation? Do we  even take care about our mental horizon ? As often been trending these days that “ Mental health is important and essential to live a normal life”. As a trend setter what we again do is “ open our laptops - read enormous articles regarding overcoming stress , anxiety , and all other mental illness etc.” I don't say it is inncorrect but the way to proceed is not okay . "ITS OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY “— but when we think in that manner the first thought which strikes our mind - “ Have I gone mad ?” “ M I losing my mental balance ?” “ I will be left with no one “ “ I cannot lose my job “ “ I cannot lose my family “ “ Society will not accept me “ “ Who will pay my EMIs?” “ How will I cope up with myself “ and the list keeps on and on with no end to it.



Please note readers we can think of  all other aspects but not about ourself . “ What about my healthy life? “ “ What about my mental peace ?” What about my soul which is  been affected because of such suffocation or mental exhausation ?”  Do we even throw some light on ourselves .I  assure you  readrers, till date  its only in reading content or lecturing content that people speak or discuss alot but in practicality a very few would adopt it to their highest level. 



We need to be mean for our ownselves . We need to be selfish in taking care of oursleves . We need to rethink our lives beyond all worthy pleasures and materialistic surrondings which only pave some momentary happiness or a temporary satisfaction. We live in a society , I understand and  we need to follow certain norms to lead a healthy life but if we care to think about ourselves, we need to take care of our mental health . Each one of you reading this text ,question yourself “ when was the last time did we thought solely or crudely for your soul or your mind ?” Just think if you were given some time in your life exclusively after completing your daily work — will you love to explore your mental horizon ? , the ultimate bliss of knowing onself. How did “ Lord Buddha “ attained his  enlightenement or Moksha ?  Does it even question us or is it like a story for each one of us ? Knock knock ……..are we even realising the fact how it is so important to understand our mental horizon . As  I have experienced    “ A happy mind always keeps the soul happy , leading to a healthy life”



Lets rethink again with our mind and soul to keep it lively and thoughtful and not for the sake of the society!
